# AWS-Security


**BASH one-liners**

A few BASH one liners to grab the status of security configurations for common AWS services such as server side encryption, logging, etc.
Requires credentials to be read VIA environment variables for ~/.aws/credentials 
Services that are region-specific will require modification to the $region variable. 

Future plans:
* I plan on creating more BASH one-liners, which I port from my AWS enumeration tool written in python
If desired, I have a huge nasty BASH script that uses these one liners and more that I can publish.


**AWS security and best practices checklist**

This is a live document-- expect updates!

Future plans (possibly videos as well):
* Serverless event-injection walkthrough
* AWS privilege escalation and account takeover walkthrough
* Establishing persistence with rogue policies and services
* AWS SSRF walkthrough 
* Adding more services and test cases
